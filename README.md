# 🌳 Decision Tree Classifier for Customer Purchase Prediction

This repository contains a Python implementation of a Decision Tree Classifier to predict whether a customer will purchase a product or service based on their demographic and behavioral data. The dataset used for this analysis is the Bank Marketing dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

## 📊 Dataset

The Bank Marketing dataset contains information about marketing campaigns of a Portuguese banking institution. It includes various demographic and behavioral features of clients such as age, job, marital status, education, whether they have credit in default, housing loan status, personal loan status, etc. The target variable is whether the client subscribed to a term deposit ('yes' or 'no').

## 📂 Project Structure

- **decision_tree_classifier.ipynb**: Colab Notebook containing the Python code for data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization.
- **bank.csv**: The dataset used for training the decision tree classifier.
- **README.md**: This file providing an overview of the project.

## 🛠️ Requirements

To run the code in the Jupyter Notebook, you need the following libraries:

- 🐼 Pandas
- 🔢 NumPy
- 📊 Matplotlib
- 🌊 Seaborn
- 🧠 Scikit-learn

## 🚀 Usage

1. Clone the repository:

```
